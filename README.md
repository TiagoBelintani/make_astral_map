# make_astral_map
make_astral_map is a lightweight Python utility that scans directories of NEXUS and FASTA alignment files, extracts all unique taxa, and generates an ASTRAL-compatible map file. It can optionally apply a user-provided taxonomy from a CSV/TSV, making it easy to prepare species mapping for large phylogenomic datasets without manual editing.
